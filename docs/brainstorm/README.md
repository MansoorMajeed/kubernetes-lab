# Brainstorm docs

This folder contains bunch of brainstorm ideas on how to build this local infrastructure.
I have used several LLMs in some brainstorming sessions to design a realistic microservices architecture.

## üõí Business Concept: "LocalMart" E-commerce Platform

**Goal**: Build a realistic microservices architecture that mimics a modern e-commerce business - something concrete that everyone can immediately understand and relate to.

### Why E-commerce?
- **Universally understood** - Everyone has shopped online
- **Clear user journey** - Browse ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Track Order ‚Üí Review
- **Rich business logic** - Inventory, pricing, payments, shipping
- **Realistic data relationships** - Products, Users, Orders, Reviews
- **Immediate visual feedback** - You can actually "shop" and see the system working

### Core User Flows
1. **Product Discovery**: Browse categories, search, view product details
2. **Shopping**: Add to cart, modify quantities, see running total
3. **Checkout**: Enter shipping/billing info, place order
4. **Order Management**: Track status, view order history
5. **Social**: Write reviews, see ratings

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Service Breakdown

| Service | Technology | Communication | Database | Responsibility |
|---------|------------|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Product Catalog** | Go | HTTP/REST | PostgreSQL | Products, categories, search, inventory |
| **Shopping Cart** | Python/FastAPI | HTTP/REST | Redis | Cart sessions, item management |
| **Order Service** | Java/Spring Boot | gRPC | PostgreSQL | Checkout process, order lifecycle |
| **User Service** | Node.js/TypeScript | gRPC | MongoDB | Authentication, profiles, JWT tokens |
| **Frontend** | React/TypeScript | HTTP/REST | - | Web interface, responsive design |

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Products, orders, structured transactional data
- **MongoDB**: User profiles, flexible document storage
- **Redis**: Session storage, cart persistence, caching layer

### Why This Tech Stack?
- **Go**: High performance, excellent observability tooling
- **Python/FastAPI**: Async capabilities, great for rapid development
- **Java/Spring Boot**: Enterprise patterns, rich metrics/monitoring
- **Node.js/TypeScript**: Event-driven architecture, different runtime characteristics
- **React**: Modern frontend with component reusability
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance, structured data
- **MongoDB**: Document storage, flexible schemas
- **Redis**: Fast session management and caching

### Communication Patterns
- **HTTP/REST**: Public APIs, frontend communication
- **gRPC**: Internal service communication (Order ‚Üî User services)
- **Mixed approach**: Real-world scenarios where both protocols coexist

## üìã Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 Languages)
**Goal**: Basic services with observability

**Services to Build:**
- [ ] Product Catalog Service (Go)
  - CRUD operations for products
  - HTTP/REST API
  - PostgreSQL integration
  - Structured JSON logging
- [ ] Shopping Cart Service (Python/FastAPI)
  - Session-based cart management
  - HTTP/REST API
  - Redis persistence
  - Structured JSON logging
- [ ] Frontend (React)
  - Product listing page
  - Shopping cart UI
  - HTTP calls to backend services

**Infrastructure:**
- [ ] PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Redis cache
- [ ] Basic observability (logs, metrics)

**Success Criteria:**
- 2 backend services running and communicating
- Basic product browsing and cart functionality
- Structured logging across all services
- Prometheus metrics collection

### Phase 2: Add gRPC + More Languages (4 Total)
**Goal**: Mixed communication patterns and more diverse runtime characteristics

**New Services:**
- [ ] Order Service (Java/Spring Boot)
  - gRPC API for internal communication
  - PostgreSQL for order data
  - JVM metrics and monitoring
- [ ] User Service (Node.js/TypeScript)
  - gRPC API for internal communication
  - MongoDB for user profiles
  - Event-loop monitoring

**Communication Patterns:**
- [ ] Frontend ‚Üí Backend: HTTP/REST
- [ ] Order Service ‚Üî User Service: gRPC
- [ ] Mixed protocol monitoring

**New Infrastructure:**
- [ ] MongoDB database
- [ ] gRPC service discovery
- [ ] Multi-language observability

### Phase 3: Advanced Observability
**Goal**: Production-ready monitoring and alerting

**Observability Features:**
- [ ] Distributed tracing (HTTP + gRPC)
- [ ] SLI/SLO monitoring
- [ ] Custom dashboards per service
- [ ] Alerting rules
- [ ] Performance profiling

**Monitoring Patterns:**
- [ ] JVM metrics (Java service)
- [ ] Event loop metrics (Node.js service)
- [ ] Go runtime metrics
- [ ] Python async metrics
- [ ] Database performance metrics

### Phase 4: Operational Excellence
**Goal**: Real-world SRE practices

**SRE Features:**
- [ ] Runbook automation
- [ ] Incident response procedures
- [ ] Load testing and capacity planning
- [ ] Graceful degradation patterns
- [ ] Health check endpoints

## üéØ Learning Objectives

### Microservices Patterns
- Service decomposition strategies
- Inter-service communication (HTTP/REST)
- Data consistency patterns
- Service discovery and load balancing

### Kubernetes Concepts
- Deployment strategies
- Service mesh basics
- Config management
- Secrets handling
- Ingress and networking

### Observability
- Structured logging across services
- Metrics collection and alerting
- Request tracing
- Performance monitoring


## ü§î Open Questions & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database per service vs shared database?**
  - Start with shared PostgreSQL for simplicity
  - Migrate to per-service databases as complexity grows
  
- **Synchronous vs asynchronous communication?**
  - Start with HTTP/REST for simplicity
  - Add message queues for order processing later

- **Frontend architecture?**
  - Single React app initially
  - Consider micro-frontends if complexity grows

### Technical Decisions
- **Authentication strategy?**
  - JWT tokens with User Service
  - Consider OAuth integration later
  
- **Cart persistence?**
  - Redis for anonymous users
  - PostgreSQL for authenticated users
  
- **Image handling?**
  - Start with placeholder images
  - Add proper image upload/storage later

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All services running healthy in k3d
- Complete request tracing across services
- Comprehensive logging with proper correlation
- Sub-second response times for main user flows

### Business Metrics
- Complete purchase funnel working
- User registration and login flow
- Order tracking functionality
- Product review system operational

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Document current state** - What infrastructure is already in place?
2. **Create database schema** - Design the foundational data model
3. **Build Phase 1 services** - Start with Product Catalog
4. **Set up CI/CD** - Automated testing and deployment
5. **Implement observability** - Logging and monitoring from day one

# Brainstorm docs

This folder contains bunch of brainstorm ideas on how to build this local infrastructure.
I have used several LLMs in some brainstorming sessions to design a realistic microservices architecture.

## üõí Business Concept: "LocalMart" E-commerce Platform

**Goal**: Build a realistic microservices architecture that mimics a modern e-commerce business - something concrete that everyone can immediately understand and relate to.

### Why E-commerce?
- **Universally understood** - Everyone has shopped online
- **Clear user journey** - Browse ‚Üí Add to Cart ‚Üí Checkout ‚Üí Track Order ‚Üí Review
- **Rich business logic** - Inventory, pricing, payments, shipping
- **Realistic data relationships** - Products, Users, Orders, Reviews
- **Immediate visual feedback** - You can actually "shop" and see the system working

### Core User Flows
1. **Product Discovery**: Browse categories, search, view product details
2. **Shopping**: Add to cart, modify quantities, see running total
3. **Checkout**: Enter shipping/billing info, place order
4. **Order Management**: Track status, view order history
5. **Social**: Write reviews, see ratings

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Service Breakdown

| Service | Technology | Responsibility |
|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Product Catalog** | Go | Products, categories, search, inventory management |
| **Shopping Cart** | Python | Cart sessions, item management, persistence |
| **Order Service** | Go | Checkout process, order lifecycle, status tracking |
| **User Service** | Python | Authentication, profiles, JWT tokens |
| **Review Service** | Go | Product reviews, ratings, moderation |
| **Frontend** | React/TypeScript | Web interface, responsive design |

### Data Layer
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for all persistent data
- **Redis**: Session storage, cart persistence, caching layer

### Why This Tech Stack?
- **Go**: High performance for order processing and product catalog
- **Python**: Great for data processing and user management
- **React**: Modern frontend with component reusability
- **PostgreSQL**: ACID compliance for financial transactions
- **Redis**: Fast session management and caching

## üìã Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP)
**Goal**: Basic working e-commerce store

**Services to Build:**
- [ ] Product Catalog Service (Go)
  - CRUD operations for products
  - Basic category support
  - Simple search functionality
- [ ] Shopping Cart Service (Python)
  - Session-based cart management
  - Add/remove/update items
  - Calculate totals
- [ ] Frontend (React)
  - Product listing page
  - Product detail page
  - Shopping cart UI
  - Basic checkout form

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- Products table
-- Categories table
-- Cart sessions table
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Can browse products
- Can add items to cart
- Can see cart total
- Can complete basic checkout

### Phase 2: User Management
**Goal**: User accounts and order tracking

**Services to Build:**
- [ ] User Service (Python)
  - User registration/login
  - JWT authentication
  - Profile management
- [ ] Order Service (Go)
  - Convert cart to order
  - Order status tracking
  - Order history

**New Features:**
- User accounts and authentication
- Persistent cart across sessions
- Order history and tracking
- User profile management

### Phase 3: Social Features
**Goal**: Reviews and ratings

**Services to Build:**
- [ ] Review Service (Go)
  - Product reviews and ratings
  - Review moderation
  - Aggregate ratings

**New Features:**
- Product reviews and ratings
- Review aggregation
- User review history

### Phase 4: Advanced E-commerce
**Goal**: Real-world features

**Enhancements:**
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Inventory management
- [ ] Product recommendations
- [ ] Discount codes and promotions
- [ ] Multi-category navigation
- [ ] Wishlist functionality

### Phase 5: Observability & Reliability
**Goal**: Production-ready monitoring

**Observability:**
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for purchase funnels
- [ ] Metrics for conversion rates
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting
- [ ] Distributed tracing across services

**Reliability:**
- [ ] Graceful degradation
- [ ] Load testing

## üéØ Learning Objectives

### Microservices Patterns
- Service decomposition strategies
- Inter-service communication (HTTP/REST)
- Data consistency patterns
- Service discovery and load balancing

### Kubernetes Concepts
- Deployment strategies
- Service mesh basics
- Config management
- Secrets handling
- Ingress and networking

### Observability
- Structured logging across services
- Metrics collection and alerting
- Request tracing
- Performance monitoring


## ü§î Open Questions & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database per service vs shared database?**
  - Start with shared PostgreSQL for simplicity
  - Migrate to per-service databases as complexity grows
  
- **Synchronous vs asynchronous communication?**
  - Start with HTTP/REST for simplicity
  - Add message queues for order processing later

- **Frontend architecture?**
  - Single React app initially
  - Consider micro-frontends if complexity grows

### Technical Decisions
- **Authentication strategy?**
  - JWT tokens with User Service
  - Consider OAuth integration later
  
- **Cart persistence?**
  - Redis for anonymous users
  - PostgreSQL for authenticated users
  
- **Image handling?**
  - Start with placeholder images
  - Add proper image upload/storage later

## üìà Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- All services running healthy in k3d
- Complete request tracing across services
- Comprehensive logging with proper correlation
- Sub-second response times for main user flows

### Business Metrics
- Complete purchase funnel working
- User registration and login flow
- Order tracking functionality
- Product review system operational

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Document current state** - What infrastructure is already in place?
2. **Create database schema** - Design the foundational data model
3. **Build Phase 1 services** - Start with Product Catalog
4. **Set up CI/CD** - Automated testing and deployment
5. **Implement observability** - Logging and monitoring from day one

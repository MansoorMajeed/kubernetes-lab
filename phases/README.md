**Learning Path Benefits:**
- **üéØ Progressive Complexity**: Each phase introduces new concepts without overwhelming learners
- **üîÑ Iterative Enhancement**: Frontend grows with each backend service addition
- **üìö Technology Diversity**: Experience with Go, Python, React, multiple databases
- **üè≠ Production Patterns**: Real-world observability and microservices patterns
- **üõ†Ô∏è Full-Stack Learning**: Frontend to backend to infrastructure

## Getting Started

### Quick Start for Any Phase

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mansoormajeed/kubernetes-lab.git
   cd kubernetes-lab
   ```

2. **Checkout the desired phase**:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0.0-monitoring-foundation  # or any other phase tag
   ```

3. **Start the lab environment**:
   ```bash
   ./setup-lab.sh
   ./tilt-lab up
   ```
   
   üéØ **Important**: Tilt handles all deployment automation. You don't need to manually run kubectl commands!

4. **Follow the phase-specific learning guide**:
   ```bash
   cat phases/phase-1/README.md
   ```

### Automation vs. Learning

**ü§ñ Tilt Automation**: 
- Handles all Kubernetes deployments automatically
- Manages service builds, deployments, and configurations
- Provides a unified development experience

**üìö Learning Focus**:
- Phase documentation explains **concepts** and **what's happening**
- You can explore the git tag to see **individual manifests** and understand components
- Exercises help you **interact with** and **understand** the deployed services
- No need to manually run deployment commands - focus on learning!

### Phase Navigation

- Each phase directory contains:
  - `README.md`: Detailed instructions and learning objectives
  - `SETUP.md`: Step-by-step setup instructions (future)
  - `EXERCISES.md`: Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning (future)
  - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Common issues and solutions (future)

### How to Use This Repository

**üéØ For Learners**: 
- Checkout a phase tag to see what the system looked like at that point
- Use `./tilt-lab up` to automatically deploy everything
- Focus on understanding concepts, not manual deployment
- Explore the deployed services and their interactions

**üîç For Understanding**:
- Look at the Kubernetes manifests in each phase to understand the components
- Read the source code to see how services are implemented
- Check the Tiltfile to understand the deployment automation
- Use the git diff between phases to see what changed

**üìö For Teaching**:
- Each phase has clear learning objectives and concepts
- Exercises focus on exploration and understanding
- Documentation explains the "why" behind each technology choice

## Release Management

### For Maintainers: Creating New Phase Releases

1. **Prepare the phase**:
   - Ensure all features are complete and tested
   - Update documentation in `phases/phase-X/`
   - Update main `README.md` if needed

2. **Create a pull request**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b phase-2.1.0-prometheus-metrics
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add Prometheus metrics to catalog service (v2.1.0)"
   git push origin phase-2.1.0-prometheus-metrics
   ```

3. **After PR is merged, create the tag**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v2.1.0-prometheus-metrics -m "Phase 2.1.0: Add Prometheus metrics to catalog service"
   git push origin v2.1.0-prometheus-metrics
   ```

4. **Create GitHub release**:
   - Go to GitHub releases page
   - Select the tag
   - Add release notes with:
     - What's new in this phase
     - Learning objectives
     - Prerequisites
     - Estimated completion time

### For Learners: Switching Between Phases

```bash
# List available phases
git tag | grep -E 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'

# Switch to a specific phase
git checkout v1.0.0-monitoring-foundation

# Always start the lab fresh after switching
./setup-lab.sh
```

## Contributing

When contributing new phases or improvements:

1. **Follow the phase structure** - Each phase should build logically on the previous
2. **Update documentation** - Ensure all phase docs are current
3. **Test thoroughly** - Each phase should work independently
4. **Consider prerequisites** - Make sure learning progression is smooth
5. **Add exercises** - Include hands-on activities to reinforce concepts

## Support

- **Issues**: Report bugs or suggestions via GitHub issues
- **Discussions**: Join conversations about learning paths and improvements
- **Documentation**: Help improve phase documentation and exercises

**Remember**: This is a learning environment. It's safe to experiment, break things, and start over. Each phase is designed to be independent and recoverable.

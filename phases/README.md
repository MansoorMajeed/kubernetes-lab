# Kubernetes Lab Learning Phases

This directory contains documentation for each learning phase of the Kubernetes Lab project. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing learners to progressively build their understanding of Kubernetes, observability, and cloud-native technologies.

## Learning Progression

### Phase 1: Foundation (v1.x) - Observability Stack
**Goal**: Set up a complete observability stack on Kubernetes
- **v1.0.0**: Basic k3d cluster with Prometheus + Grafana
- **v1.1.0**: Add Loki for log aggregation
- **v1.2.0**: Add Alloy for log collection
- **v1.3.0**: Custom dashboards and alerting rules

**Prerequisites**: Basic Docker and Kubernetes knowledge
**Duration**: 2-3 hours
**Key Concepts**: Kubernetes deployments, services, persistent volumes, Helm charts

### Phase 2: First Service (v2.x) - Application Observability
**Goal**: Deploy and monitor a single Go microservice
- **v2.0.0**: Deploy catalog service with basic Kubernetes resources
- **v2.1.0**: Add Prometheus metrics to Go service
- **v2.2.0**: Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- **v2.3.0**: Implement structured logging with Loki integration

**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 completed
**Duration**: 3-4 hours
**Key Concepts**: Application metrics, tracing, structured logging, health checks

### Phase 3: Microservices (v3.x) - Service Communication
TODO

**Prerequisites**: Phase 2 completed
**Key Concepts**: Service discovery, load balancing, circuit breakers, service mesh

### Phase 4: Advanced Observability (v4.x) - Production Readiness
TODO

**Prerequisites**: Phase 3 completed
**Duration**: 5-6 hours
**Key Concepts**: SLIs/SLOs, error budgets, incident response, cost optimization

## Getting Started

### Quick Start for Any Phase

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mansoormajeed/kubernetes-lab.git
   cd kubernetes-lab
   ```

2. **Checkout the desired phase**:
   ```bash
   git checkout v1.0.0-monitoring-foundation  # or any other phase tag
   ```

3. **Start the lab environment**:
   ```bash
   ./start-lab.sh
   ./tilt-lab up
   ```
   
   üéØ **Important**: Tilt handles all deployment automation. You don't need to manually run kubectl commands!

4. **Follow the phase-specific learning guide**:
   ```bash
   cat phases/phase-1/README.md
   ```

### Automation vs. Learning

**ü§ñ Tilt Automation**: 
- Handles all Kubernetes deployments automatically
- Manages service builds, deployments, and configurations
- Provides a unified development experience

**üìö Learning Focus**:
- Phase documentation explains **concepts** and **what's happening**
- You can explore the git tag to see **individual manifests** and understand components
- Exercises help you **interact with** and **understand** the deployed services
- No need to manually run deployment commands - focus on learning!

### Phase Navigation

- Each phase directory contains:
  - `README.md`: Detailed instructions and learning objectives
  - `SETUP.md`: Step-by-step setup instructions (future)
  - `EXERCISES.md`: Hands-on exercises to reinforce learning (future)
  - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`: Common issues and solutions (future)

### How to Use This Repository

**üéØ For Learners**: 
- Checkout a phase tag to see what the system looked like at that point
- Use `./tilt-lab up` to automatically deploy everything
- Focus on understanding concepts, not manual deployment
- Explore the deployed services and their interactions

**üîç For Understanding**:
- Look at the Kubernetes manifests in each phase to understand the components
- Read the source code to see how services are implemented
- Check the Tiltfile to understand the deployment automation
- Use the git diff between phases to see what changed

**üìö For Teaching**:
- Each phase has clear learning objectives and concepts
- Exercises focus on exploration and understanding
- Documentation explains the "why" behind each technology choice

## Release Management

### For Maintainers: Creating New Phase Releases

1. **Prepare the phase**:
   - Ensure all features are complete and tested
   - Update documentation in `phases/phase-X/`
   - Update main `README.md` if needed

2. **Create a pull request**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b phase-2.1.0-prometheus-metrics
   # Make your changes
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add Prometheus metrics to catalog service (v2.1.0)"
   git push origin phase-2.1.0-prometheus-metrics
   ```

3. **After PR is merged, create the tag**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git tag -a v2.1.0-prometheus-metrics -m "Phase 2.1.0: Add Prometheus metrics to catalog service"
   git push origin v2.1.0-prometheus-metrics
   ```

4. **Create GitHub release**:
   - Go to GitHub releases page
   - Select the tag
   - Add release notes with:
     - What's new in this phase
     - Learning objectives
     - Prerequisites
     - Estimated completion time

### For Learners: Switching Between Phases

```bash
# List available phases
git tag | grep -E 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+'

# Switch to a specific phase
git checkout v1.0.0-monitoring-foundation

# Always start the lab fresh after switching
./start-lab.sh
```

## Contributing

When contributing new phases or improvements:

1. **Follow the phase structure** - Each phase should build logically on the previous
2. **Update documentation** - Ensure all phase docs are current
3. **Test thoroughly** - Each phase should work independently
4. **Consider prerequisites** - Make sure learning progression is smooth
5. **Add exercises** - Include hands-on activities to reinforce concepts

## Support

- **Issues**: Report bugs or suggestions via GitHub issues
- **Discussions**: Join conversations about learning paths and improvements
- **Documentation**: Help improve phase documentation and exercises

**Remember**: This is a learning environment. It's safe to experiment, break things, and start over. Each phase is designed to be independent and recoverable.
